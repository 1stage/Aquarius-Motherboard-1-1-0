R50 = 1K5
R51 = 1K5
R52 = 100â„¦ 
R14 = 680R (not 2.2K)
R15 = 2.2K (not 1.2k)
R25 = 2.7k (not 4.7k)
R13 - Via very close
R49 - Goes to Via Below (+5V), for PAL, not the stated Hole (GND) (seems R49 has 2 holes!)

C38 = 100pf not 0.1uf as described

C1 = 10uf 
Tracks from PSU -> switch ->7805 very thin
Pin 21 U5 needs to go to +5v
Jumper (open - PAL/close - NTSC) between U11 Pin 12 and U6 Pin 2 (PCB is drilled to break the track on PAL version)
